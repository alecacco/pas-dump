This repo is dump of every single thing I've written in Pascal through my high school years. It is _messy, very messy_, a disomogeneous blob of stuff I wrote for assignments, stuff people asked me to create or - best of all - stuff I designed myself. This includes my long-time brag console games, including Pacman (PAScman, hell yeah) Asteroids (PASteroids, you see the naming pattern?), snake, Space Invaders (Space PAScaders, of course), a database ""manager"" (dasatabe, yeah I know, I thought it was funny), Enduro (Nduro, this almost makes sense), a recipes organizer (OrgRic), a Paint program (PYL-PaintYourLife, it even has documentation, go figure).

I have no idea how depth of a cringiness pit I'm pushing to the Internet, obviously I'm not taking ANY responsibility for it. It was not even me writing all this stuff, it was young-me, I don't even like that dude.

To whoever found this repo out, I have two questions: HOW and WHY?! Also, what do you even think you can gather from the crazy work of a nerdy and lonely 17 years old boy from 2012? You know what, nvm, you do you. 

PS:
The best game is by far is PAScman but it has a hardcoded path to my old drive for assets, they are in a subfolder here.
PPS:
If you thing the first hundred millions lines of each source file are weirdly repetitive, they are just printing the cool title. I did a thing with a program that wrote the code to draw a picture I created with PYL and copy-pasted everything into the single pas file. I didn't know better at the time, _it ain't stupid if it works immaright_? Well in hindsight, it was pretty stupid. Silly dude that 2012 guy.
